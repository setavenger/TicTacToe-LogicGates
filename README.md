A simple tic-tac-toe implementation using simple logic gates.
Run an example by running `tictactoe.py` in `src`. One can change the result by changing the the fields which become high and by changing the order in which they are set to high.

[Based on this implementation](https://hackaday.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/11/circuitchef-7400-tic-tac-toe.pdf).
